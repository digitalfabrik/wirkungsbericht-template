### Problems when using pandoc

- smart quotes do not work (disable with -t latex-smart)
- special word graphics are missing -> create images and include them
- tables are overflowing
- chapter count is included in text -> remove them
- Fix enumerate and itemize environments (quote environment has to be removed)
- \noindent bei Grafiken in neuen Absätzen hinzufügen
